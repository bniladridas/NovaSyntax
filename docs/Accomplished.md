Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

* Created a basic lexer that can tokenize:
	+ Keywords (func, let, return)
	+ Identifiers
	+ Numbers
	+ Strings
	+ Operators (+, -, =)
	+ Delimiters (, (), {})
* Implemented robust error handling
* Set up a build system with CMake
* Created unit tests to verify lexer functionality
Next steps could include:

* Developing a parser to convert tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
* Implementing an interpreter or compiler
* Expanding language features
