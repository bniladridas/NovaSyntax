- [ ] Create initial language specification

### Future Roadmap
1. Implement core language features
2. Develop compiler/interpreter
3. Create standard library
4. Design language-specific tooling

## Development Metrics
- Total Commits: 11
- Test Coverage: Comprehensive
- Language Features Implemented: 
  * Basic Tokenization
  * Advanced Number Tokenization
- Test Suite: 4 passing tests covering various token scenarios

## Challenges Overcome
